																	Greetings! So you're interested in knowing a bit more about who this crazy guy hosting a website called smashing the stack? Well 
																	that's cool, I feel special now! :D
																	<p>
																	So my name is Calvin Ference, also known as w3b_wizzard and also known as Vezril (gamer name). For those who don't know me in real life
																	I'm your typical geek who has a fascination with photography and music.
																	<p>
																	So, here's a short biography!<br>
																	Dec 7 1988: Calvin Is born!<br>
																	1989: Berlin Wall went down (i was there! :D)<br>
																	1991: Moved back to Canada!<br>
																	1995: Got My first computer, A 386 running windows 95 :)<br>
																	1996: Took my first computer apart.(Thanks Dad!)<br>
																	1998: Upgraded to win98 (that was THE shiz). I also started to learn Pascal, but never got really far<br>
																	2001: Started Learning Visual Basic 5. <br>
																	2002: Started Learning Java. But never liked it.<br>
																	2003: This is the year I started using Fedora Core 1 (back in the day when it was called Core). I also started to learn Perl.<br>
																	2005: Started Learning C and got interested in computer security (more the hacking side... guess I started as script kiddy back then)<br>
																	2006: Started to learn Python, and moved from Fedora to Debian<br>
																	2007: Graduated High-School and met some cool people on the interwebz who showed me how to destroy computers from afar... they know who they are ;) This is also the year I started college in Computer Engineering. Also this is where I started using Slackware (9.3 if I recall)(still used Debian for other things)<br>
																	2009: Made a pack that I should learn Java, not because I want to program in the stupid thing but to make fun of other Java programmers who think they're cool and shiz by proving to them how crappy Java is. Yes I actually made that pack.<br>
																	2010: Graduted college and started working as a System's Administrator<br>
																	2011: Was accepted in Computer Engineering in University (Don't ask, Qc educational system is screwed up badly)... also the year this site has been created and learned the following languages: Prolog, Scala, Ruby, Erlang, Haskell, Io, Clojure<br>
																	<p>
																	Well that sums it up, you can see that I started young with computers, mostly due to my Dad who encouraged me to think outside the box (paying a little tribute to the ol'man here). So from this
																	biography, you can pretty much guess what I like, and maybe even guess a bit my personality. I'm a big fan of beer and Scottish whiskey, love my coffee black like my metal and I randomly write
																	random stuff and make fun of people. Well that's all about me, please send me an email to why and how you got unto this website, I'd like to hear more about who visists this little space on the interweb.
																	<p>
																	Enjoy the website and I'm always glad to hear tips and suggestions on how to improve this. Also feel free to ask questions and If I get the time and I like the question, I will answer the best I can and maybe even post it on this webspace.
																	<br> Until we talk again!
